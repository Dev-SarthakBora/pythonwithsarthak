Hello fellow developers this file is for reference to get a quick understanding of how this actual module works also the frontend is completely made with AI (chat gpt ) cuz the main reason here was to learn flask.
Starter Guide:
--> first install all the requirements 
use    pip install -r requirements.txt in the terminal
-->run the main.py file 
-->now click on the local server endpoint generated which is shown on the terminal after running main.py
ex  http://127.0.0.1:5000
--> now you will be directed to the main todo interface and you have access to the actual project 

            about the files
--> models.py == describes the database's schema
--> views.py == holds all the routing endpoints and the functionality at each endpoints
--> __init__.py ==  is the file that holds the main create_app function that starts with creating all the necessities like flask app object and db object for database
--> at last static and templates are folders to hold static elements like CSS and JS or images whereas templates holds the html templates or pages to be rendered..             
-->further modifications are welcomed.....+
